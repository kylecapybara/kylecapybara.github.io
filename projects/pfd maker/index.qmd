Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) are a useful tool in visualizing chemical engineering processes, but making them with tikzpictures is very annoying and slow. But if you use tikzpictures/latex  the diagram will be rendered as a vector graphic so you can zoom in without losing image quality. This project works at making them as easily as you'd edit a google slide show or something. 

Here are some examples of PDFs I made with the help of my gui (the whole document is [here](https://github.com/kylecapybara/pfdmaker/blob/main/hw7latex/hw7.pdf))
